## SECTION 2 : EXECUTIVE SUMMARY / PAPER ABSTRACT

The current NUS-ISS website is targeted at prospective students rather than existing students. It is difficult to search for related information and data pertaining to non-curriculum (such as nearest canteen, nearest facilities) or student guides (student handbooks).  
 It has been identified that there are already existing NUS-ISS chatbots developed. These NUS-ISS chatbots cannot provide accurate responses to queries and are confined to fixed responses. They only accept limited follow-up questions. These chatbots are also outdated and do not provide easy means for extension. Frequent changes to the NUS-ISS curriculum or information could not be easily updated into the chat system.  
In summary, the problems of existing solutions can be summarised in the following points
•	Relevancy of information
•	Difficulty of updating information

The proposed intelligent chatbot is going to address these gaps of the current NUS-ISS chatbots. The delivery of the MVP (Minimum Viable Prototype) is going to demonstrate the chatbot’s capability of delivering accurate and up-to-date information. 
 The following diagram illustrates the business flow for the proposed solution.
